Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€

If you're here by accident, no worriesâ€”feel free to browse around. If you're here on purpose, great! Let's see what we can build together.

## About Me

I'm a professional currently navigating the rapid changes brought by AI and LLMs in my industry. While my position is secure, I'm driven to understand and adapt to these technologiesâ€”both to stay ahead in the workplace and to explore how they can complement human skills rather than replace them.

## Skills in Progress:

- **Python**: Learning the ropes.
- **SQL**: Querying databases like a pro.
- **JavaScript**: Building interactive experiences.
- **HTML/CSS**: Brushing up on the fundamentals from my MySpace days.

## Featured Projects:

### The Esoteric (under development)
My personal website, blending art and techâ€”a digital canvas for experimental projects like an underground, late-night radio show about the unexplained. Think of it as a virtual campfire where stories of mystery and wonder come alive.

### Vox Populi (under development)
A community-focused bot designed to streamline content moderation and repetitive tasks, giving community managers more time to engage and interact with their audiences.

## Connect with Me

If you'd like to chat, collaborate, or just share a spooky story, I'd love to hear from you!
