Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

If you're here by accident, no worries—feel free to browse around. If you're here on purpose, great! Let's see what we can build together.

## About Me

I'm a professional currently navigating the rapid changes brought by AI and LLMs in my industry. While my position is secure, I'm driven to understand and adapt to these technologies—both to stay ahead in the workplace and to explore how they can complement human skills rather than replace them.

## Skills in Progress:

- **Python**: Learning the ropes.
- **SQL**: Querying databases like a pro.
- **JavaScript**: Building interactive experiences.
- **HTML/CSS**: Brushing up on the fundamentals from my MySpace days.

## Featured Projects:

### The Esoteric (under development)
My personal website, blending art and tech—a digital canvas for experimental projects like an underground, late-night radio show about the unexplained. Think of it as a virtual campfire where stories of mystery and wonder come alive.

### Vox Populi (under development)
A community-focused bot designed to streamline content moderation and repetitive tasks, giving community managers more time to engage and interact with their audiences.

## Connect with Me

If you'd like to chat, collaborate, or just share a spooky story, I'd love to hear from you!
